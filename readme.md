# Repository Description

This is a Wordpress 4 theme using the design from [`regdoug/ritplayers-web`](https://github.com/regdoug/ritplayers-web/).  It is built using [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).

The theme itself includes a topbar compliant with the Rochester Institute of Technology branding guidelines and each post has an image background.


## Parent Theme

This theme is a child of [Cornerstone](https://github.com/thewirelessguy/cornerstone).  `functions.php` is based off the [`cornerstone-child-theme`](https://github.com/thewirelessguy/cornerstone-child-theme) except that since this project uses SASS, the CSS files from Cornerstone are not needed.


## The codebase

This is based on a starter kit for developing WordPress themes with [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), and [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) found at [`synapticism/wordpress-gulp-bower-sass`](https://github.com/synapticism/wordpress-gulp-bower-sass).
The core `gulpfile.js` has been adapted from [Matt Banks](http://mattbanks.me/gulp-wordpress-development/). Additional credit is due to [Mark Goodyear](http://markgoodyear.com/2014/01/getting-started-with-gulp/).
